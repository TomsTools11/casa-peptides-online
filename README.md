## Usage

### Browsing the Catalog

Navigate to `/catalog` to view all 127 products. Use the category tabs to filter by category, the search bar for keyword lookup, or the price-range inputs to narrow results. Toggle between card and table views, and sort by name, price, or category.

### Product Details

Click any product card to view its detail page at `/catalog/product/[slug]`. Each page shows specifications, available size variants (with pill selectors that link between sizes), and related products from the same category.

### Comparing Products

Check the compare box on up to 4 product cards. A floating compare bar appears at the bottom of the screen — click "Compare Now" to open the side-by-side comparison view at `/compare`. Use the "Highlight Differences" toggle to visually spot variations across products.

### Blog

Visit `/blog` to read research articles. Posts are authored in MDX under `src/content/blog/` and support category-based filtering.

---

## Adding Content

### New Product

Add a new entry to `src/data/peptides.json` following the existing object schema (name, category, catalog number, sizes, prices, description).

### New Blog Post

Create a new `.mdx` file in `src/content/blog/` with frontmatter for title, date, category, and excerpt. The blog system will pick it up automatically.
